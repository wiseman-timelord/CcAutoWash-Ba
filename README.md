# CcAutoWash-Ba

### STATUS: WORKING
Pretty much as good as it needs to be, few minor refinements may come.

## DESCRIPTION
RamDisks will always be cut fine, as they need not eat system ram, obviously this is intended for people whom put their, TEMP and TMP, on a RamDisk, this requires a certain delay after the user logs on, in order to process the cleaning. This clearly is a simple idea, but, that is the point, I am presenting an idea to enhance RamDisk configurations, comically named `AutoWash` after `Fifth Element` and done in the style of my newer batch files.
